I guess it's gonna rain
All the kids're back home
The wind among the trees
Gives a one last kiss goodnight
It's time to hide
Twinkle, twinkle, Little Star
Tell me, tell me where you are
Name the beasts that stalks at night
In your mystic light
While
The sun is dying at dusk
The sun is dying at dusk
I guess it's gonna snow
All the kids are dead
The blizzard's crawling
That's all we get
Turn off the light
It's time to hide
Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water
Jack got busted, jailed and killed
Jill died little afterwhile
The sun is dying at dusk
The sun is dying at dusk
The sun is dying at dusk
The sun is dying at dusk
